                    <h3>January 28th, 2026</h3>

                    <p>The article by Naema Baskanderi, “Best Practices for Modals/Overlays/Dialog Windows," provides interesting insights into how modals affect our designs. Overlays are a common design encounter, everyone has had the experience of first clicking onto a website and being greeted with a pop up window. Naema describes the feeling of this interaction perfectly, explaining that users immediately try to click out of it to get back to their original task. This is the reason why overlays need to be used intentionally with the user’s screen and interaction in mind.</p>

                    <p>Modal windows can be used to grab attention, collect user input, and provide any additional information. The window places focus on its provided context and prevents immediate interaction to the parent page. It is additionally important to design the window itself in a way that is visually structured for the user to easily scan and exit. A key design in the window is the escape hatch, providing both a button and escape key for the user to press to close the modal. The buttons on the modal window should be clearly labeled and even match the title, aiding users in the flow of tasks clearly. </p>

                    <p class="custom">Modals should almost, if not, always use a lightbox effect. Darkening the background visually gives information to the user while drawing attention to the modal itself.  This design provides context to the user that the pop up window currently blocks any interaction with the parent page until they click out or finish the task of the modal. However, the modal should not pop up without being followed by the user actions, clicking a button, link, or option on the parent page. The modals are useful to save space on a website and focus attention on one task, but their misuse of design and pop ups can trigger users to exit the page or skip over it entirely.</p>

                    <h3>January 19th, 2026</h3>

                    <p>The article discusses important design habits to consider when creating forms. Users are quick to abandon a form if it is too complex or confusing, stressing the importance of a clean and efficient design. Designing a form involves considering expected mistakes, since most users rush through the form. I thought it was interesting how forms provide small details to guide the user through the form, leaving these details out will likely end in a mistake occurring. A well designed form ensures that all needs of the users are implemented to ensure and motivate the individual to finish the form.</p>

                    <p class="custom">The design of the form defines the way in which a user will interact and behave with the form. Simplifying, aligning, and minimizing are a few of the ways in which inputs can be modified for the user to fill out effectively with little mistakes. Leaving margins for error will help to ease the frustration users will likely experience when filling out any form. Defining incorrect inputs, labels, and placeholder texts are important details to incorporate into the form. Defining and stating inputs in simple terms for each box will make the experience of filling out a form less frustrating for your users. The design of the form itself will determine the likelihood of users successfully it out.</p>

                    <p class="custom">I recently had to remake a password and ID for my Discover account, after forgetting to write the information down when I first made it. The process was easy to follow and the cognitive load on each page was minimal. I was able to go through the process in under 5 minutes after completing the required security confirmations.</p>
