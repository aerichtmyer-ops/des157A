                    <p>The article discusses important design habits to consider when creating forms. Users are quick to abandon a form if it is too complex or confusing, stressing the importance of a clean and efficient design. Designing a form involves considering expected mistakes, since most users rush through the form. I thought it was interesting how forms provide small details to guide the user through the form, leaving these details out will likely end in a mistake occurring. A well designed form ensures that all needs of the users are implemented to ensure and motivate the individual to finish the form.</p>

                    <p class="custom">The design of the form defines the way in which a user will interact and behave with the form. Simplifying, aligning, and minimizing are a few of the ways in which inputs can be modified for the user to fill out effectively with little mistakes. Leaving margins for error will help to ease the frustration users will likely experience when filling out any form. Defining incorrect inputs, labels, and placeholder texts are important details to incorporate into the form. Defining and stating inputs in simple terms for each box will make the experience of filling out a form less frustrating for your users. The design of the form itself will determine the likelihood of users successfully it out.</p>

                    <p class="custom">I recently had to remake a password and ID for my Discover account, after forgetting to write the information down when I first made it. The process was easy to follow and the cognitive load on each page was minimal. I was able to go through the process in under 5 minutes after completing the required security confirmations.</p>
